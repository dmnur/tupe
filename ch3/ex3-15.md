# Task

```
$ for i in `pick ch2.*`
> do
>	echo $i:
>	diff old/$i $i
> done | pr | lpr
ch2.1? y
ch2.2?
ch2.3?
ch2.4? y
ch2.5? y
ch2.6?
ch2.7?
$
```

If the `diff` loop were placed in a shell file, would you put the `pick` in
the shell file? Why or why not?


# Solution

I wouldn't. Scripts should be generic and usable non-interactively.
If a user wanted to pick files, he could type:
```
$ the-script `pick ch2.*`
```

However, if you often need this particular use case, you can use aliases
and functions. Looks like v7 didn't have those, but modern shells do.

The best practice would be to leave the script generic. Then you could define
some aliases:
```
alias diffch2='(cd && the-script $(pick ch2.*))'
alias diffch3='(cd && the-script $(pick ch3.*))'
...
```

Or, even better, write a function:
```
diffch() (
	cd && the-script $(pick ch$1.*)
)
```

And call it like this:
```
$ diffch 2
$ diffch 3
...
```
