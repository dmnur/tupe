# Task

What are the differences among the following three commands?
```
$ cat file | pr
$ pr <file
$ pr file
```


# Solution

The first command uses a pipe. `pr` won't know anything about the file.
This creates two processes instead of one, and as such is less effective.
A typical example of [the useless use of `cat`][cat-award].

The second command uses I/O redirection. `pr` won't know anything about
the file. This method won't let you use multiple files (and that would be
the *useful* use of `cat`).

The third command uses `pr`'s own capabilities. The shell passes the file name
as an argument to `pr`, which then opens it itself. `pr` will treat every file
in separate and print its name in the header, so the output will differ
from the other methods.
