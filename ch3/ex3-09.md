# Task

Look in `/bin` and `/usr/bin` to see how many commands are actually
shell files. Can you do it with one command? How accurate are guesses based
on file length?


# Solution

```
find /bin /usr/bin -type f -exec file {} + | grep -c 'shell script'
```

`grep -c` prints the number of selected lines, so we don't need `wc -l`.

To print names of these files, change the part on the right to this:
```
awk -F: '/shell script/ {print $1}'
```

Note that `find` and GNU `file` don't follow symlinks by default.
Use `find -L` and `file -L` if you need this.
