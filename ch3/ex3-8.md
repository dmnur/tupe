# Task

If you type
```
$ rm *
```
why can't `rm` warn you that you're about to delete all your files?


# Solution

That's because `rm` just gets a list of arguments, it doesn't know that
these are all files in the directory.

It could actually check this by comparing its argument list with
the directory contents, but whatever.
