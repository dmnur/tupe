# Task

```
$ for i in `pick ch2.*`
> do
>	echo $i:
>	diff old/$i $i
> done | pr | lpr
ch2.1? y
ch2.2?
ch2.3?
ch2.4? y
ch2.5? y
ch2.6?
ch2.7?
$
```

What happens if the last line of the loop above is
```
> done | pr | lpr &
```
that is, ends with an ampersand? See if you can figure it out, then try it.


# Solution

My guess is that `pick` won't be able to read input, will fall back
to default answers ("no"), and because of it will output nothing,
so the loop won't run at all. It would be as if we typed:
```
for i in ; do ...
```

The pipe will be empty, so `pr` will output nothing and `lpr` won't get
anything. I don't know if a printer will print a blank page in the end.

They say to try it, but we don't have `pick` yet to do so. :)

Well, let's check by removing `pick`:
```
$ for i in # nothing
> do
>	echo $i:
>	diff old/$i $i
> done | pr | lpr &
[1] 5803
$ lpr: No file in print request.  # output over the prompt; press Enter

[1]+  Exit 1                  for i in ;
do
    echo $i:; diff old/$i $i;
done | pr | lpr
$
```

I don't have a printer, but I configured CUPS to print to PDF. As you can see,
`lpr` printed an error and exited without sending any print jobs. Nice.

Funny thing: if we substitute `pick` with `cat`, the shell job will just stop:
```
$ for i in `cat`
> do
>	echo $i:
>	diff old/$i $i
> done | pr | lpr &
[1] 6795
$  # press Enter

[1]+  Stopped                 for i in `cat`;
do
    echo $i:; diff old/$i $i;
done | pr | lpr
$ kill %
$  # again, press Enter
$
[1]   Terminated              for i in `cat`;
do
    echo $i:; diff old/$i $i;
done | pr | lpr
$
```

So maybe I was wrong. We'll see when we'll have `pick` handy. (TODO)
