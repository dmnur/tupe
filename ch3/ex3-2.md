# Task

Explain the output produced by
```
$ ls .*
```


# Solution

Let's assume we have the following files in the current directory:
```
.
..
.profile
junk
```

`ls .*` will become `ls . .. .profile`. When the argument is a directory,
`ls` lists its contents, not itself, by default.

So in this case `ls` will list the contents of `.` (current directory)
and `..` (parent directory), and then `.profile` file itself.
