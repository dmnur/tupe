# Task

Modify `bundle` so it includes with each file the information garnered
from `ls -l`, particularly permissions and date of last change.
Contrast the facilities of `bundle` with the archive program `ar(1)`.


# Solution

For the modified version of `bundle` see the exercise directory.

As for the second task, nobody uses `ar(1)` anymore. Well, except for packing
libraries. So let's compare with `tar(1)` instead.

`tar` is more robust than `bundle`: it handles any file contents fine,
so we don't need to figure out what end-of-file marker won't break things.
It handles directories and links, and stores some inode data too, which it
can gracefully preserve if you need. It had some limitations on file path
length in the past, but the POSIX `pax` format fixed those.

One thing `tar` still can't do is indexing. So to extract just one file
we need to pass through all files before it, including their contents.
And to get a list of files in the archive we need to read the entire archive.
