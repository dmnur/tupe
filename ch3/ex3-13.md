# Task

Why do we always include the current directory in `PATH`?
Where should it be placed?


# Solution

Well, I guess at the time of writing the book nobody thought about the danger
of `PATH` containing the current directory (see `NOTES.md`).

Of course, it's convenient and natural when you can just type `foo` to execute
`./foo`. Nowadays newbies often ask why that doesn't work. I was there too.

The current directory should be the first in `PATH` because there may be a file
with the same name in other directories. The most common case is when one
puts a test script in the file `test` and tries to execute it, but the shell
actually executes `/usr/bin/test` (or the builtin), confusing the user.
