# Task

How do you tell `grep` to search for a pattern beginning with a `-`?
Why doesn't quoting the argument help?


# Solution

Quoting doesn't help because it affects only shell expansion;
`grep` still gets the same argument. If you quote more so that `grep`
actually gets the string with quotes, the behavior won't be that you expected:
```
$ grep "'-a'"
```

This will search for the string `'-a'`, not `-a`.

To search for the string `-a`, use the `-e` option:
```
$ grep -e -a
```
