# Task

Compare the here-document version of `411` with the original.
Which is easier to maintain? Which is a better basis for a general service?


# Solution

The here-document version is easier to maintain, but for a general service
it's better to read the phone database from a separate file.

Tools should be generic anyway, separating data from code is always
a good practice.

My idea is to read some common database by default, but provide a way
to specify filenames with additional parameters, like this:
```
$ 411 santa 'dow jones' -- file1 file2
```

And, of course, specifying `-` as a filename would allow reading from *stdin*.
