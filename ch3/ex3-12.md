# Task

```
$ grep -l <pattern> <filenames>
```
lists the filenames in which there was a match of `<pattern>`, but produces
no other output. Try some variations on
```
$ <command> `grep -l <pattern> <filenames>`
```


# Solution

One silly example I can think of is:
```
$ chmod +x `grep -l '^#!' *`
```

This gives the execution permission to all files containing a shebang.
