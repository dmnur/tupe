# Task

(Trick question) How do you get a `/` into a filename (i.e., a `/` that
doesn't separate components of the path)?


# Solution

This question is really tricky. On modern systems you can't do this, period.
You can't directly edit the contents of a directory. Linux doesn't even allow
you to read a directory (e.g. `od dir` doesn't work there, but works
in FreeBSD).

Maybe in Research Unix v7 you could. If that's true, then you would need
to somehow open a directory for editing a change a file name there.
