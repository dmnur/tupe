# Task

What happens with
```
$ cat x y >y
```
and with
```
$ cat x >>x
```

Think before rushing off to try them.


# Solution

```
$ cat x y >y
```
The shell first opens `y` for writing, truncating it. Then `cat` reads
the file, which is already empty. So in the end `y` becomes a copy of `x`.
**UPD**: only with buffered I/O. With unbuffered I/O an infinite loop occurs:
having read `x`, `cat` starts reading `y`, which already has `x`' contents.

```
$ cat x >>x
```
This one is trickier. The shell opens `x` for writing, without truncating,
setting the position to the end of the file. Then `cat` reads this file
from its beginning and writes to its end at the same time. It never reaches
the end of the file. Infinite loop.
**UPD**: with buffered I/O, `x`' contents get duplicated. The loop occurs only
with unbuffered I/O.

See the exercise's directory to test it yourself. There you'll find
buffered (`cat.c`) and unbuffered (`ucat.c`) `cat` implementations.
To compile, just type `make cat` or `make ucat`. You'll need `make` and
a C compiler for that, of course.

GNU `cat` actually handles these situations by issuing the error and aborting:
```
cat: x: input file is output file
```
