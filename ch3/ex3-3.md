# Task

Predict what each of the following `grep` commands will do, then verify
your understanding.
```
grep \$     grep \\
grep \\$    grep \\\\
grep \\\$   grep "\$"
grep '\$'   grep '"$'
grep '\'$'  grep "$"
```


# Solution

```
Command     Expanded  Comment
----------  --------  -------------------------------------------------------
grep \$     grep $    `$` is the end of a line in `grep`; matches every line
grep \\$    grep \$   `$` by itself: fall back to literal;
                      matches lines containing `$`
grep \\\$   grep \$   Matches lines containing `$`
grep '\$'   grep \$   Matches lines containing `$`
grep '\'$'  grep \$'  The shell will wait for the closing quote
grep \\     grep \    `grep` will issue a syntax error
grep \\\\   grep \\   Matches lines containing `\`
grep "\$"   grep $    Matches lines containing `$`
grep '"$'   grep "$   Matches lines containing `"$`
grep "$"    grep $    `$` by itself: fall back to literal; matches every line
```
