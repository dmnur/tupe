# Task

How would you use `bundle` to send all the files in a directory and its
subdirectories? Hint: shell files can be recursive.


# Solution

I don't get the hint.

My first guess is to do the following:
```
$ pwd
/home/dmn/bin
$ bundle $(find . -type f -print) | mail bob@somewhere
```
But there's a problem: Bob would need to create all the subdirectories himself.
The task, I think, implies that we shouldn't edit the code, so... Poor Bob.

The second try:
```
$ pwd
/home/dmn/bin
$ for d in $(find . -type d -print)
> do (
>	cd $d
>	bundle $(for f in *; do [ -f $f ] && echo $f; done)
> ); done | mail bob@somewhere
```
This one is ugly as hell, but it works.

Anyway, folks, just use `tar(1)`.
